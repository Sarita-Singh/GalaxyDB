> GalaxyDB is a scalable database as a service using sharding written in Go. It is the descendent of our friendly old [Traffic Wizard](https://github.com/chirag-ghosh/traffic-wizard). RIP mate. Like it's parent, this cute muchkin is also religious in it's own way and follows the New Testament found [here](./bible_new_testament.pdf). Lastly, this is the second assignment for Distributed Systems course taken by [Dr. Sandip Chakraborty](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sandipc/) for Spring-2024.
